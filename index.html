      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a mixed-media artist / theatrical lighting designer, hoping to get a job in the tech industry. I got my BA in computer science back at the turn of the century, and have continued coding in my spare time ever since. However, my fundmentals are all rusty, and I'm completely ignorant about a ton of innovations over the last twenty years. Apparently they are doing just incredible things with javascript these days!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Chapel Hill, NC, but I've lived in Chicago for the last 18 years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p><em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</em>, making musical instruments, piano</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Coding for a non-profit, or some company that is actually working to improve the world. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Roger's Park, ten feet south of Evanston.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love being able to identify some problem, and to just sit down and create a solution for it. For example, I wanted to practice sight reading sheet music. If the music is too complex, however, my poor skill as a pianist means that I won't be able to practice. But if the music is too simple, then I'll end up memorizing it instead of sight reading it! I was able to code a customizable web interface that automatically generated a new piece of music every time, simple enough for me to play, but always changing, and with a randomly generated title each time!</p>
